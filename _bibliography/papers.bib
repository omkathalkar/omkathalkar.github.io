  author={{Om Kathalkar} and Ansh Shah and Sachin Chaudhari and Anoop Namboodiri},
  abstract={A system 100 for accurately determining Air Quality Index (AQI) in urban environments exhibiting high spatial and temporal variability is disclosed. The system includes a mobile platform 102 equipped with a multi-camera data acquisition system 108 and an array of environmental sensors 104. The multi-camera data acquisition system 108 includes front-facing camera 110, rear-facing camera 112, and 360-degree camera 114 configured to capture real-time environmental imagery. The environmental sensors 104 include particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) sensors 116, noise sensors 118, and contextual sensors 120 for collecting weather and temporal data. An edge computing device 106, operatively connected to the cameras and sensors, processes the acquired data using deep learning-based feature extraction pipelines 126. The system performs visual and contextual feature fusion through cross-view alignment and modality concatenation, followed by encoding with a transformer-based encoder 128 incorporating multi-head attention.},

  title={202441043706 - System and Method for Determining Air Quality by Processing Environmental and Traffic-Related Visual Data},
  author={{Om Kathalkar} and Nitin Nilesh and Sachin Chaudhari and Anoop Namboodiri},
  abstract={A system 100 and method are disclosed for automated air quality determination using multimodal data fusion and a transformer-based deep learning architecture. The system (100) receives synchronized video streams from a first camera (104) and a second camera (106) along with environmental sensor data from an air quality monitoring device (108). Images are sampled at defined intervals, annotated with sensor data and contextual metadata, and processed using a frozen convolutional neural network to extract feature vectors. These visual features are combined with standardized sensor readings and encoded contextual information to form a unified feature representation. A custom transformer model projects this representation into a token sequence with positional encoding. The final classification is performed using the transformer’s last token output, which captures attention-weighted spatial-temporal correlations between visual indicators and environmental factors. The system outputs a six-category air quality index (AQI) classification, including good, satisfactory, moderate, poor, very poor, or severe.},

  abstract={Air quality estimation through sensor-based methods is widely used. Nevertheless, their frequent failures and maintenance challenges constrain the scalability of air pollution monitoring efforts. Recently, it has been demonstrated that air quality estimation can be done using image-based methods. These methods offer several advantages including ease of use, scalability, and low cost. However, the accuracy of these methods hinges significantly on the diversity and magnitude of the dataset utilized. The advancement of air quality estimation through image analysis has been limited due to the lack of available datasets. Addressing this gap, we present TRAQID - Traffic-Related Air Quality Image Dataset, a novel dataset capturing 26,678 front and rear images of traffic alongside co-located weather parameters, multiple levels of Particulate Matters (PM) and Air Quality Index (AQI) values. Spanning over multiple seasons, with over 70 hours of data collection in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, India, the TRAQID offers diverse day and night imagery amid unstructured traffic conditions, encompassing six AQI categories ranging from “Good” to “Severe”. State-of-the-art air quality estimation techniques, which were trained on a smaller and less-diverse dataset, showed poor results on the dataset presented in this paper. TRAQID models various uncertainty types, including seasonal changes, unstructured traffic patterns, and lighting conditions. The information from the two views (front and rear) of the traffic can be combined to improve the estimation performance in such challenging conditions. As such, the TRAQID serves as a benchmark for image-based air quality estimation tasks and AQI prediction, given its diversity and magnitude.},

  abstract= {Particulate Matter (PM) is a major air pollutant that has the potential for adversely affecting human health. Actionable data on the spatial distribution of temporal variability of PM2.5 emission hot spots in large cities are sparse. The main objective of this research is to provide a protocol for using search agents to hunt for PM2.5 emission hot spots in urban environments. We propose short-range identification of variability of harmful PM2.5 concentrations can be achieved using IoT devices mounted on a mobile platform. We propose that long-range identification of the PM2.5 emission hot spots can be attained by searching through the city on different days. We applied this approach to Hyderabad, India by fixing a mobile platform on a street car. We corrected the IoT device measurement errors by calibrating the sensing component data against a reference instrument co-located on the mobile platform. We identified that random forest regression was the most suitable technique to reduce the variability between the IoT devices. The spatial variability of PM2.5 harmful emission hot spots at industrial settings and congested roads were identified. The temporal variability based on image processing shows a weak correlation between PM2.5 concentrations and the number of vehicles, and PM2.5 and visibility. The Hyderabad PM2.5 emission hot spots findings demonstrate a clear need to inform people with heart and lung conditions when it is unhealthy to be outside, and when it is unhealthy for children and elderly people to be outside for prolonged periods. Our emission hunting approach can be applied to any mobile platform carried by people walking, cycling, or by drones and robots in any city.},

  abstract={Remote Triggered Labs (RTL) are helpful for students to work on laboratory experiments virtually anytime, anywhere. Such setups can facilitate distance learning and are helpful during pandemics. In this paper, the use of Computer Vision (CV) is demonstrated for RTL experiments. For this, a use-case of the Conservation of Mechanical Energy experiment is considered. A CV-based approach is used to estimate an object’s velocity whose setup primarily consists of a microprocessor, a camera and infrared (IR) sensors. The experiment is recorded, and various CV techniques are employed to estimate the object’s velocity. This paper also compares a CV-based and an IR sensor-based approach to estimate the object’s velocity. Linear regression applied to the CV-based implementation resulted in an optimal mean-squared error (MSE), nearly 10 times better than IR-based implementation.},
