  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={Air quality estimation through sensor-based methods is widely used. Nevertheless, their frequent failures and maintenance challenges constrain the scalability of air pollution monitoring efforts. Recently, it has been demonstrated that air quality estimation can be done using image-based methods. These methods offer several advantages including ease of use, scalability, and low cost. However, the accuracy of these methods hinges significantly on the diversity and magnitude of the dataset utilized. The advancement of air quality estimation through image analysis has been limited due to the lack of available datasets. Addressing this gap, we present TRAQID - Traffic-Related Air Quality Image Dataset, a novel dataset capturing 26,678 front and rear images of traffic alongside co-located weather parameters, multiple levels of Particulate Matters (PM) and Air Quality Index (AQI) values. Spanning over multiple seasons, with over 70 hours of data collection in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, India, the TRAQID offers diverse day and night imagery amid unstructured traffic conditions, encompassing six AQI categories ranging from “Good” to “Severe”. State-of-the-art air quality estimation techniques, which were trained on a smaller and less-diverse dataset, showed poor results on the dataset presented in this paper. TRAQID models various uncertainty types, including seasonal changes, unstructured traffic patterns, and lighting conditions. The information from the two views (front and rear) of the traffic can be combined to improve the estimation performance in such challenging conditions. As such, the TRAQID serves as a benchmark for image-based air quality estimation tasks and AQI prediction, given its diversity and magnitude.},
