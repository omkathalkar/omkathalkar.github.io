Namboodiri</a> (<a href="https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CVIT</a>, IIIT Hyderabad). Please find my resume <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G9_sc6aL1YrccvRaF4GdNbe4v1RDtdvo/view?usp=sharing" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a></strong>. My research focuses on developing <strong>efficient and adaptive AI systems</strong> that can operate reliably in <strong>resource-constrained and real-world environments</strong>, with applications spanning <strong>environmental sensing, smart cities, and robotics</strong>. My <a href="https://omkathalkar.github.io/publications/">publications</a> reflect these contributions, and I have been awarded the <a href="https://ihub-data.ai/archives/blogs/5998/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">iHub-Data Fellowship</a> for my MS research.</p> <p>I am currently a <strong>Researcher at Ericsson Research</strong>, contributing to the European <a href="https://pandora-heu.eu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PANDORA project</a>. My work centers on <strong>network-aware path planning for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs)</strong>, where I design algorithms that integrate <strong>AI inference with wireless network dynamics</strong>. By combining <strong>edge intelligence and adaptive decision-making</strong>, my research aims to ensure reliable robot navigation in dynamic industrial environments, even under constrained connectivity.</p> <p>I completed my B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication at <a href="https://www.stvincentngp.edu.in/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">St. Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering and Technology, Nagpur</a> (SVPCET), with the guidance of <a href="https://www.stvincentngp.edu.in/faculties/view/34" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Shriraghavan R. Madbushi</a>. At SVPCET, I achieved AIR-1 in the Gold Award at the e-Yantra Ideas Competition organized by IIT Bombay, received the <strong>Student of the Year award</strong> for the engineering 2023 batch and for the Electronics and Telecommunication Department, and secured the Best Project Award for my final-year project.</p> <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing cricket, hockey, and badminton, hiking, and writing short stories and poetry. I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amravati" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amravati, Maharashtra</a>, one of India’s oldest continuously inhabited cities.</p> <h3 id="research">Research</h3> <p>My research interests encompass various domains, including Edge AI, Internet of Things, Computer Vision, Machine &amp; Deep Learning, and Environmental Sensing.</p> <h2 id="featured-media">Featured Media</h2> <p>Some places where my work has been highlighted.</p> <h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3> <p>I am passionate about education and mentoring. At <a href="https://talentsprint.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoruCeg3vOWrY0fkSuGi06p49esrpKXLBN8X7ubhhi0VJYEteYo8" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NSE TalentSprint</a>, I mentor the <a href="https://talentsprint.com/course/ai-machine-learning-iiit-hyderabad" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AIML certification program</a>, transforming industry professionals into ML practitioners through intensive training in neural architectures, NLP, and computer vision. I guide teams from concept to deployment, helping professionals implement production-ready AI solutions. At IIIT Hyderabad’s IoT &amp; Embedded Workshop Lab, I pioneer the implementation of ML models on <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/hardware/qualcomm-innovators-development-kit" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Qualcomm’s QIDK platform</a>, where I teach undergrad and postgrad students to break through edge computing barriers. Students learn to optimize ML models for mobile platforms, focusing on real-time inference and efficient resource utilization on Snapdragon SoCs. Beyond urban centres, I’ve reached 200+ students in rural engineering colleges, introducing them to ML and IoT fundamentals.</p> </body></html>
