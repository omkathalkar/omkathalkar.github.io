I am currently looking for exciting **PhD opportunities** in the areas of Applied AI, Edge Intelligence, and Efficient AI Inference!!!  

üëã Hi, I am an MS by Research student at IIIT Hyderabad and a Research Scholar at the [Signal Processing and Communication Research Centre (SPCRC)](https://spcrc.iiit.ac.in/), supervised by [Prof. Sachin Chaudhari](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~sachin.c/) (SPCRC, IIIT Hyderabad) and [Prof. Anoop M. Namboodiri](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~anoop/) ([CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), IIIT Hyderabad). Please find my **[resume here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G9_sc6aL1YrccvRaF4GdNbe4v1RDtdvo/view?usp=sharing)**. My areas of interest include **Applied AI, Edge Intelligence, Federated Learning, Computer Vision, and the Internet of Things (IoT)**. I have recently submitted my **MS Thesis titled ‚ÄúCamera-Based Deep Learning Framework for AQI Estimation: Dataset and Methodology‚Äù**, where I developed scalable, sensor-free methods for urban air quality monitoring. My research focuses on developing **efficient and adaptive AI systems** that can operate reliably in **resource-constrained and real-world environments**, with applications spanning **environmental sensing, smart cities, and robotics**. My [publications](https://omkathalkar.github.io/publications/) reflect these contributions, and I have been awarded the prestigious [iHub-Data Fellowship](https://ihub-data.ai/archives/blogs/5998/) for my MS research.  

I am currently a **Researcher at Ericsson Research**, contributing to the European [PANDORA project](https://pandora-heu.eu/). My work centers on **network-aware path planning for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs)**, where I design algorithms that integrate **AI inference with wireless network dynamics**. By combining **edge intelligence and adaptive decision-making**, my research aims to ensure reliable robot navigation in dynamic industrial environments, even under constrained connectivity.  


I completed my B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication at [St. Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering and Technology, Nagpur](https://www.stvincentngp.edu.in/) (SVPCET), with the guidance of [Dr. Shriraghavan R. Madbushi](https://www.stvincentngp.edu.in/faculties/view/34). At SVPCET, I achieved AIR-1 in the Gold Award at the e-Yantra Ideas Competition organized by IIT Bombay, received the **Student of the Year award** for the engineering 2023 batch and for the Electronics and Telecommunication Department, and secured the Best Project Award for my final-year project.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing cricket, hockey, and badminton, hiking, and writing short stories and poetry. I was born and raised in [Amravati, Maharashtra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amravati), one of India‚Äôs oldest continuously inhabited cities.

### Research 

My research interests encompass various domains, including Edge AI, Internet of Things, Computer Vision, Machine & Deep Learning, and Environmental Sensing.

### Teaching

I am passionate about education and mentoring. At [NSE TalentSprint](https://talentsprint.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoruCeg3vOWrY0fkSuGi06p49esrpKXLBN8X7ubhhi0VJYEteYo8), I mentor the [AIML certification program](https://talentsprint.com/course/ai-machine-learning-iiit-hyderabad), transforming industry professionals into ML practitioners through intensive training in neural architectures, NLP, and computer vision. I guide teams from concept to deployment, helping professionals implement production-ready AI solutions. At IIIT Hyderabad's IoT & Embedded Workshop Lab, I pioneer the implementation of ML models on [Qualcomm's QIDK platform](https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/hardware/qualcomm-innovators-development-kit), where I teach undergrad and postgrad students to break through edge computing barriers. Students learn to optimize ML models for mobile platforms, focusing on real-time inference and efficient resource utilization on Snapdragon SoCs. Beyond urban centres, I've reached 200+ students in rural engineering colleges, introducing them to ML and IoT fundamentals.
