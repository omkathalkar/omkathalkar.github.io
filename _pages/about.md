### Research 


### Teaching

I am passionate about education and mentoring. At [NSE TalentSprint](https://talentsprint.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoruCeg3vOWrY0fkSuGi06p49esrpKXLBN8X7ubhhi0VJYEteYo8), I mentor the [AIML certification program](https://talentsprint.com/course/ai-machine-learning-iiit-hyderabad), transforming industry professionals into ML practitioners through intensive training in neural architectures, NLP, and computer vision. I guide teams from concept to deployment, helping professionals implement production-ready AI solutions. At IIIT Hyderabad's IoT & Embedded Workshop Lab, I pioneer the implementation of ML models on [Qualcomm's QIDK platform](https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/hardware/qualcomm-innovators-development-kit), where I teach undergrad and postgrad students to break through edge computing barriers. Students learn to optimize ML models for mobile platforms, focusing on real-time inference and efficient resource utilization on Snapdragon SoCs. Beyond urban centres, I've reached 200+ students in rural engineering colleges, introducing them to ML and IoT fundamentals.
