ðŸ‘‹Â Hi, I am an MS by Research student at IIIT Hyderabad. I work as a Research Scholar at the [Signal Processing and Communication Research Centre (SPCRC)](https://spcrc.iiit.ac.in/) under the supervision of [Prof. Sachin Chaudhari](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~sachin.c/) at SPCRC, IIIT Hyderabad, and [Prof. Anoop M. Namboodiri](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~anoop/) at [CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), IIIT Hyderabad. My areas of interest are Computer Vision and Machine Learning, with research focused on Applied AI for environmental issues. My [publications](https://omkathalkar.github.io/publications/) cover work in this area. I am awarded by the [iHub-Data Fellowship](https://ihub-data.ai/archives/blogs/5998/) for my MS research.

I completed my B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication at [St. Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering and Technology, Nagpur](https://www.stvincentngp.edu.in/) (SVPCET), under the guidance of [Dr. Shriraghavan R. Madbushi](https://www.stvincentngp.edu.in/faculties/view/34). During my bachelor's at SVPCET, I achieved AIR-1 in the Gold Award category at the e-Yantra Ideas Competition organized by IIT Bombay and was recognized as the Student of the Year for the 2023 batch in the Electronics and Telecommunication Department, as well as the Best Project Award for my final-year project.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing cricket, hockey, and badminton, hiking, and writing short stories and poetry. I was born and raised in [Amravati, Maharashtra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amravati), one of Indiaâ€™s oldest continuously inhabited cities.

### Research 

My research interests encompass various domains, including Generative AI, Environmental Sensing, Computer Vision, Machine & Deep Learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

### Teaching

I am passionate about education and mentoring. At [NSE TalentSprint](https://talentsprint.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoruCeg3vOWrY0fkSuGi06p49esrpKXLBN8X7ubhhi0VJYEteYo8), I mentor the [AIML certification program](https://talentsprint.com/course/ai-machine-learning-iiit-hyderabad), transforming industry professionals into ML practitioners through intensive training in neural architectures, NLP, and computer vision. I guide teams from concept to deployment, helping professionals implement production-ready AI solutions. At IIIT Hyderabad's IoT & Embedded Workshop Lab, I pioneer the implementation of ML models on [Qualcomm's QIDK platform](https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/hardware/qualcomm-innovators-development-kit), where I teach undergrad and postgrad students to break through edge computing barriers. Students learn to optimize ML models for mobile platforms, focusing on real-time inference and efficient resource utilization on Snapdragon SoCs. Beyond urban centres, I've reached 200+ students in rural engineering colleges, introducing them to ML and IoT fundamentals.
