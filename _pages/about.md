ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am an MS by Research student at IIIT Hyderabad and a Research Scholar at the [Signal Processing and Communication Research Centre (SPCRC)](https://spcrc.iiit.ac.in/), supervised by [Prof. Sachin Chaudhari](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~sachin.c/) (SPCRC, IIIT Hyderabad) and [Prof. Anoop M. Namboodiri](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~anoop/) ([CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), IIIT Hyderabad). My areas of interest include Computer Vision and Machine Learning, with my research specifically focused on Applied AI to address environmental issues. My [publications](https://omkathalkar.github.io/publications/) highlight my contributions in this domain. I have been awarded the prestigious [iHub-Data Fellowship](https://ihub-data.ai/archives/blogs/5998/) for my MS research.

I recently joined [Ericsson Research](https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/research-papers?locs=68304,46951) as a Researcher, where I represent Ericsson in the [European PANDORA project](https://pandora-heu.eu/). My current work involves investigating and implementing path planning algorithms for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), emphasizing optimization of navigation using Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning (DRL).

I completed my B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication at [St. Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering and Technology, Nagpur](https://www.stvincentngp.edu.in/) (SVPCET), with the guidance of [Dr. Shriraghavan R. Madbushi](https://www.stvincentngp.edu.in/faculties/view/34). At SVPCET, I achieved AIR-1 in the Gold Award at the e-Yantra Ideas Competition organized by IIT Bombay, received the **Student of the Year award** for the engineering 2023 batch and for the Electronics and Telecommunication Department, and secured the Best Project Award for my final-year project.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing cricket, hockey, and badminton, hiking, and writing short stories and poetry. I was born and raised in [Amravati, Maharashtra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amravati), one of Indiaâ€™s oldest continuously inhabited cities.

### Research 

My research interests encompass various domains, including Edge AI, Internet of Things, Computer Vision, Machine & Deep Learning, and Environmental Sensing.

### Teaching

I am passionate about education and mentoring. At [NSE TalentSprint](https://talentsprint.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoruCeg3vOWrY0fkSuGi06p49esrpKXLBN8X7ubhhi0VJYEteYo8), I mentor the [AIML certification program](https://talentsprint.com/course/ai-machine-learning-iiit-hyderabad), transforming industry professionals into ML practitioners through intensive training in neural architectures, NLP, and computer vision. I guide teams from concept to deployment, helping professionals implement production-ready AI solutions. At IIIT Hyderabad's IoT & Embedded Workshop Lab, I pioneer the implementation of ML models on [Qualcomm's QIDK platform](https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/hardware/qualcomm-innovators-development-kit), where I teach undergrad and postgrad students to break through edge computing barriers. Students learn to optimize ML models for mobile platforms, focusing on real-time inference and efficient resource utilization on Snapdragon SoCs. Beyond urban centres, I've reached 200+ students in rural engineering colleges, introducing them to ML and IoT fundamentals.
