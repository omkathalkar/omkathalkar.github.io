## Overview

Access to laboratory infrastructure remains a major barrier for students in rural and under-resourced institutions.  
This project focused on building a **large-scale remote laboratory platform** to enable students to perform real experiments over the internet.

The work was carried out at **IIIT Hyderabad**, supported by PRIF and the Department of Science and Technology (DST), India.

## Problem

- Many institutions lack physical lab infrastructure.
- Rural and underrepresented students face limited access to experimental learning.
- Hardware-based experiments cannot easily scale to thousands of learners.

We asked:

> Can physical experiments be remotely triggered, monitored, and evaluated using computer vision and IoT systems?

---

## System Architecture

The platform enabled:

- Remote triggering of physical lab setups
- Real-time video streaming of experiments
- Computer vision-based output evaluation
- Automated result validation
- Scalable web-based access

Students could:

- Perform experiments from anywhere
- Observe real-time outputs
- Receive computed results automatically

## Technical Components

- IoT-enabled hardware setups
- Computer Vision models for output analysis
- Web-based control interface
- Backend infrastructure for experiment orchestration
- Real-time streaming and logging

---

## Contributions

- Contributed to development and deployment of a scalable remote experimentation framework
- Integrated CV-based output validation mechanisms
- Supported large-scale student usage across institutions
- Enabled remote access to STEM labs for thousands of learners
