## Overview

Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) operating in industrial environments depend on stable and reliable wireless communication.  

Traditional path planning algorithms optimize for distance, time, or energy — but ignore network quality.

This project, conducted under the **Horizon Europe PANDORA initiative**, introduced a **network-aware planning framework** that integrates communication constraints into robotic decision-making.

## Problem

Industrial environments introduce:

- Signal attenuation due to metallic structures
- Variable SNR and throughput
- Latency-sensitive control loops
- Communication dead zones

Conventional planners fail to account for these constraints, leading to unreliable robot behavior.

We asked:

> Can path planning jointly optimize mobility and communication reliability?

---

## Approach

We developed a framework that integrates:

- Path planning (A*-based and learning-enhanced methods)
- Wireless communication metrics (SNR, throughput, delay)
- Spatial awareness modeling
- Environment-aware adaptation

The system enables AMRs to:

- Avoid communication drop zones
- Maintain stable connectivity
- Adapt to dynamic industrial conditions
- Improve operational reliability
