## Overview

Modern AI models are powerful but computationally heavy.  
Deploying them in real-world systems — especially industrial and edge environments — requires careful optimization of latency, memory, and energy consumption.

Under the **Horizon Europe TURING project**, this research focuses on:

- Efficient model inference
- Autonomous AI execution
- Scalable and trustworthy deployment pipelines
- Real-world industrial constraints

The work is conducted at **NTUA (ICCS – Institute of Communication and Computer Systems)**.

## Problem

Large AI models face several deployment challenges:

- High latency during inference
- Large memory footprint
- Energy inefficiency at the edge
- Limited hardware resources
- Trust and reliability concerns

We ask:

> How can AI models adapt dynamically to resource constraints while maintaining performance and reliability?

## Research Directions

This project explores:

- Efficient inference architectures
- Model compression and optimization
- Dynamic computation (e.g., conditional execution, early exits)
- Scalable deployment strategies
- Edge and industrial AI systems
- Reproducible AI pipelines for real-world environments

The broader goal is to move from **static AI models** to **adaptive and autonomous AI systems**.
